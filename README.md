# linuxtouchdriver

A very small driver written in python for intended for linux that was created to fix not being able to drag windows around on cleartouch interactive whiteboards

I cannot guarentee that this driver will work on anything but cleartouch interactive whiteboards, as that is the only thing it has been tested with.
